# IoT-Based Street Light System

## 📌 Overview
This project automates street lighting using IoT. The system turns ON street lights when it becomes dark using an LDR sensor and can be enhanced with motion detection for energy saving.

## 🚀 Features
- Automatic ON/OFF based on light intensity  
- Uses LDR and ESP32
- Low power consumption  
- Easy to implement  
- Can be connected to IoT platforms for monitoring  

## 🛠 Components Used
- ESP32
- LDR Sensor  
- LED / Street Light Model  
- Resistor (10kΩ)  
- Breadboard & jumper wires  
- PIR sensor (optional)  

## ✨ Working Principle
- LDR senses ambient light.  
- When light intensity decreases → NodeMCU turns ON light.  
- When bright → NodeMCU turns OFF light.
